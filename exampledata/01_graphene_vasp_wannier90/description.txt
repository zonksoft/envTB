A Graphene bandstructure calculation, using VASP and wannier90.
Only the files that can be processed with envTB are included at
the moment.

VASP files:
EIGENVAL - kpoints and energies of the bandstructure
POSCAR - unit cell configuration (lattice vectors, atom positions)
PROCAR - electronic density of the ground state, projected on atomic orbitals

wannier90 files:
wannier90_hr.dat - matrix elements in the Wannier-orbital basis
